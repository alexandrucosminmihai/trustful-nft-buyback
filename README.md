# trustful-nft-buyback
NFT contract with buyback functionality, but requires users' trust in the owners, as it provides functionality to change the minting and refunding prices, as well as extract all the buyback insurance ETH from the contract (with the benevolent objective of investing it for secondary profits). Based on https://github.com/alexandrucosminmihai/nft-buyback .
